### Backend for budgeter
All related websites, eg. dailydriver.info

## Made with
Laravel

## Goal
Make a personal/family budget calculator with extra features 
like dailydriver.info for delivery drivers

## status
dailydriver.info is live and running. 
there was another temp project with calculator that has been deprecated because
Laravel was outdated. Need to rewrite that bit again

## milestones
dailydriver.info went live in 2024 with a Patreon subscription option
Still need to provide some free services
